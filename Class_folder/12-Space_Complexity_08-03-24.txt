We  discussed  space  complexity  and  worked  on  finding  it.  We  discussed  how  to  build  logic  and  optimize  code  using  different  approaches. Towards  the  conclusion  of  our  discussion,  we  explored  the  concept  of  cumulative  arrays.  This  technique  involves  the  systematic  accumulation  of  values  in  an  array,  enabling  us  to  efficiently  compute  cumulative  sums  or  other  aggregations.  Through  our  exploration,  we  gained  insights  into  how  cumulative  arrays  can  be  utilized  to  simplify  complex  problems  and  improve  algorithmic  efficiency.
