In our discussion, we explored the functionality of looping statements such as for and while, which are crucial for iterating through data in programming. Additionally, we delved into the concept of arrays, which are used to store collections of values in a single variable. Understanding how to manipulate arrays is fundamental in programming, as it allows for the efficient organization and retrieval of data. Building on this knowledge, we further examined these concepts through the practical application of writing and executing programs.
