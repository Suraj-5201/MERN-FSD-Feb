We discussed time complexity and how it helps us determine the efficiency of code. For instance, different algorithms can achieve the same result, but we need to differentiate which one is more efficient, and that's where time complexity comes in. I learned that the number of iterations can result in polynomials, and applying Big O notation helps us understand the efficiency of these polynomials.
