It was the first day of discussion about Git. Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. We discussed the importance of version control systems in managing and collaborating on projects effectively. During the discussion, we learned how to initialize a Git repository in a folder, which creates a hidden .git directory where Git stores its internal files and data. We also learned how to create new files and folders within the repository, delete them when necessary, and commit our changes to Git
