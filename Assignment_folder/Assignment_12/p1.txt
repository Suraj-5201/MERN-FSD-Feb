			Global Scope											Local Scope

1. Variables declared outside of any function have global scope.				Variables declared inside a function or block have local scope.

2. Accessible from anywhere in the code, including inside functions.				Accessible only within the function or block where they are declared.

3. Exists until the application is terminated or the page is refreshed.				Limited to the lifetime of the function or block; they are destroyed 
                             									when the function or block exits.

4. Can lead to variable naming conflicts and security risks if not used carefully.		Helps in encapsulation and avoids naming conflicts by limiting variable 												scope to where they are needed
