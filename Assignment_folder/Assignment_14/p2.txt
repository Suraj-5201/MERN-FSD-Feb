2) what is the speciality tree data structure ? why it is used
-->

The tree data structure is special because it allows data to be organized hierarchically. Unlike linear data structures like arrays and linked lists, which have a linear relationship between elements, trees have a branching structure that can represent relationships like parent-child or ancestor-descendant.

Uses:

1. Hierarchical Representation: 
Trees are used to represent hierarchical data such as file systems, organization charts, and XML/HTML structures.

2. Efficient Searching:
Binary search trees (BSTs) allow for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. They maintain an order among elements that makes searching very fast (O(log n) on average).

3. Balanced Trees:
Balanced trees like AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and B-trees ensure that the tree remains balanced, which guarantees logarithmic height and thus efficient operations.

4. Sorting:
Trees can be used for sorting data efficiently, such as in a binary search tree.

5. Expression Evaluation: 
Expression trees are used to represent mathematical expressions in a way that can be easily evaluated.

6. Decision Making: 
Decision trees are used in decision analysis to model decisions and their possible consequences.

7. Routing Algorithms: 
Trees are used in network routing algorithms to determine the optimal path for data transmission.

8. Game Trees: 
Trees are used in game theory to analyze and make decisions in competitive games.8.
