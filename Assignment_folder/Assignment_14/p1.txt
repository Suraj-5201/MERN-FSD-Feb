Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, how the data is organized, and the operations that can be performed on the data. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. Each data structure has its own strengths and weaknesses, and is suitable for different types of applications and operations.
