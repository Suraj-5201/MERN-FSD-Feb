3) what is a binary tree?
-->

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child. These children are also binary trees. Binary trees are used for efficient searching, sorting, and hierarchical representation of data due to their simple yet powerful structure. In a binary tree, each node can have zero, one, or two children, making it a flexible structure for various applications. The binary tree is foundational in computer science and forms the basis for more complex data structures and algorithms.
